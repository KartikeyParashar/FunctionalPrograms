# 16. Write a program WindChill.java that takes two double commandÂ­line arguments t
# and v and prints the wind chill. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute ab.
# Given the temperature t (in Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour),
# the National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) to
# be:
# w = 35.74 + .6215t + (.4275t - 35.75)*(v**.16)
# Note : the formula is not valid if t is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger
# than 120 or less than 3 (you may assume that the values you get are in that range).
